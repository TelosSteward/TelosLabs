- Benchmark dataset specifications
- Evaluation metric proposals

### Critical Analysis
- Mathematical limitations of proposed approaches
- Theoretical boundaries and constraints
- Impossibility results or fundamental barriers
- Counterexamples to theoretical claims

## What We Cannot Accept

To maintain the theoretical nature of this repository, we cannot accept:

- Implementation code or system architectures
- Empirical validation results or performance claims
- Specific measurement algorithms or techniques
- Production deployment strategies
